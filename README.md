Data fetching dashboard to analyse and display some data retrieved from the [UK Coronavirus Data Website](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk).

*Data in image above accurate as of 22/10/2020*

Starting off in Python just to view the data for my own use, I will rewrite this in JavaScript at some point (most likely using Node, D3, and maybe React to visualize everything well).
