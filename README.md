# Covid-19 UK Dashboard

Data fetching dashboard to analyse and display some data retrieved from the [UK Coronavirus Data Website](coronavirus.data.gov.uk).

Starting off in Python just to view the data for my own use, I will rewrite this in JavaScript at some point (most likely using Node, D3, and maybe React to visualize everything well).

## Current Dependencies
* Python 3.7+
* uk_covid19 (available from link above)
